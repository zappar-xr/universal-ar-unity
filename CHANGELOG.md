## [3.2.2] - 2023-06-02

## [3.2.1] - 2023-05-31
### Fixed
- Package import error on UnityEditor version 2020.x for unsupported webGLBuildSubtarget API.
- Safari 16.4 screen orientation fix for upside-down screen in landscape mode.


## [3.2.0] - 2023-04-05
### Added
- Support for Unity silicon editor.
- New menu option: `Zappar/Editor/New AR Scene &N`. Which creates a new scene with `ZapparCamera` without any skybox and flat lighting setup for the scene.
- Provided favicon.ico as part of WebGLTemplate to avoid 404 error on start in browsers.

### Changed
- Updated `ZapparFaceMesh` to use advanced mesh API for native GFX updates respective to each platform.
- Updated `ZapparBackgroundCamera` `ClearFlags` from Skybox to SolidColor, for better mobile performance.
- Zappar in-editor publishing menu now uses WebGL 2.0 graphics API on Unity version 2021 LTS and above.
- Zappar in-editor publishing menu updates WebGL `Texture Compression` to `ETC2` in favor of mobile browsers.
- Removed `Decompression Fallback` as the default option from UAR WebGL publishing setting. Support for both `Brotli` and `Gzip` compressed builds are now fully supported from `Zapworks` [dashboard](https://my.zap.works/) and `zapworks-cli` version [2.0.4](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@zappar/zapworks-cli) and above.
- Improved WebGL build caching by enabling `WebGL.nameFilesAsHashes` from the publishing menu option, and caching zbin and zpt file types on Unity 2020 and above.
- Auto link required frameworks (`Accelerate` and `OpenGLES`) in Unity built iOS Xcode project.
- Moved the menu option `Zappar/Utilities/Full Head Depth Mask` to `Zappar/Face Tracker/Face Depth Mask`.

### Known issues
- Selecting OpenGL graphics API for windows standalone crashes the Editor. The default graphics API of Direct3D11 should work fine.
- Color space mismatch between Unity and ZCV resulting in darker camera texture with Metal API on MacOS and iOS native. A temporary fix is provided in the thread [here](https://github.com/zappar-xr/universal-ar-unity/issues/11).
- Package import error on UnityEditor version 2020.x for unsupported webGLBuildSubtarget API.



## [3.1.1] - 2023-03-27

## [3.1.0] - 2022-07-28
### Added
- Cylindrical and conical image training and tracking target type.
- New Zappar camera type of gyro (3DoF tracking) which only updates the virtual camera's attitude and optional backdrop of camera feed.
- New menu options to add additional zappar packages for webgl - `Save and Share` and `Video Recorder`.
- Editor option to exclude *.zpt files from WebGL build to minimize the build size.
- Culling property for `Zappar/UnlitTextureUV` shader, which allows off/front/back culling.

### Changed
- Zappar Instant Tracking to use new world tracking implementation.
- Reduced the Zappar Camera near clipping plane to 0.01 from 0.3.

### Known issues
- No support for Unity silicon editor.


## [3.0.1] - 2022-01-04
### Fixed
- ZapparFaceMesh is not visible when kept disabled on start. This was due to delay in receiving mesh data (verts, tris, etc.) immediately after initialization.

### Known issues
- Dark camera background texture on native iOS and Mac with Gamma color space. [Track Issue](https://github.com/zappar-xr/universal-ar-unity/issues/11)

### Added
- Multiple face tracking.

### Changed
- New flow for adding Face tracking target and subsequent anchors.
- Removed zappar prefabs from the Resources folder to optimize the build size. Instead, now use Zappar editor menu to create Zappar obects in scene.
- Improved anchor placement for Instant tracker with permissible range for Z-movement before the anchor placement. Enable this behaviour by checking the flag `MoveAnchorOnZ`.
- Replaced `MirrorRearCameras` and `MirrorUserCamera` under `ZapparCamera.cs` with `MirrorCamera`.
- Moved ZapparReflectionProbe from ZaparCamera object context menu to Editor Menu.
- Zappar Menu order in Editor has been updated.

### Fixed
